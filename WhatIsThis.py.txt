This is my first full program on python, I learnt this language by making 
it, projecting had been hard but I made it after some time. This was pretty
good experience for me, that's why this program is fascinating shape of my heart
even today.

Bot set up towers and miners to farm money and materials. It's possible to make 
loop, and farm for all day and night, but I did not think about this while I was 
developing program. So this program target plates with OpenCV and move computer mouse, 
press keyboard's buttons by pyautogui.

Project is required mobile emulator and personal screenshots and parameters to work.
